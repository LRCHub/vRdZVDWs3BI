It's like a polaroid love, it's so old fashioned when I'm with ya
My heart beats fast when you're around me
And I can't deny
Why am I caught up on these feelings?
I should be done with all the falling in love
I saw it all coming clearly
But still I fell in your trap from above
There it goes again, when you call my name
My chest hurts and then, my heart it goes boom boom
It's like a polaroid love, it's so old fashioned when I'm with ya
My heart beats fast when you're around me
And I can't deny
It's like a polaroid love, it never goes my way around ya
There's no filter in our picture
But I love that vibe
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got my heart with you always
It stays engraved with no edits involved
It's getting clearer day by day
My heart it beats all for you over all
There it goes again, when you call my name
My chest hurts and then, my heart it goes boom boom
It's like a polaroid love, it's so old fashioned when I'm with ya
My heart beats fast when you're around me
And I can't deny
It's like a polaroid love, it never goes my way around ya
There's no filter in our picture
But I love that vibe
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Polaroid love
So old fashioned with ya
Polaroid love
And I can't deny
There it goes again, when you call my name
My chest hurts and then, my heart it goes boom boom
It's like a polaroid love, it's so old fashioned when I'm with ya (when I'm with ya)
My heart beats fast when you're around me
And I can't deny
It's like a polaroid love (polaroid love), it never goes my way around ya
There's no filter in our picture
But I love that vibe
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
